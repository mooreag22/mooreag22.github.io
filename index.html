     Today is my first day writing a blog, and I am excited to get this journey started. Before we get started about my day, I'll talk a little about myself.<br/>
     I am 14 years old. I am a Freshman at Lee county High school, where I am a cheerleader, a member of the Beta Club, and attend school. Today is the first "home" <br/>
     game for our boys' bsketball team. I have to stay after school and practice untill the game starts,(which is 6:00.) I was supposed to practice with the band after school <br/>
     (p.s. I play the flute for the LCHS marching band) but cheer trumps band in my scheduele. What I'm going to end up having to do is, praactice band for an hour or so, change to practice for cheer,<br/>
     run laps for being late, and then after practice change and get ready for the game, (and somehow find the time to eat) Sometimes being involved in so much is VERY hectic. I may edit in how the practices and game <br/>
     go, later tonight if I have time. xo Anna

    Yesterday was a mess. I didn't get to practice for band, and cheer was pure (*insert cuss word here*). Then at the game I saw the guy I really like, with another girl. After the game I litterally went home and cried myself to sleep. When I woke up (expecting snow) <br/>
    I looked out the window and was sincerly dissapointed that it didn't even flurry. I then started crying (again) and my mom was going to let me stay home and have a "me day." However my cheer coach thought something else. Today we are leaving to state competetion <br/>
    We are leaving right after school, getting a hotel and waking up early in the morning to get to the actual arena where the cometition is held. I broke my leg a couple of months ago and can't compete so I texted my coach and told her I was sick and wasn't able to go to the </br>
    competition. She then explained to me that if I didn't go, it was unexcuseable. So I had to fix my tear-stained face, pack a bag, and go to school. That's not even the thing that made me mad, 3 other "alternates" aren't going...why, you might ask? Because they are going to a PARADE. </br>
    Apperantely a parade is excuseable, but not being sick and a mini pre-midlife crisis. lol
