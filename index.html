  <h3> December 6, 2018.</h3>
  <p>
     Today is my first day writing a blog, and I am excited to get this journey started. Before we get started about my day, I'll talk a little about myself.<br/>
     I am 14 years old. I am a Freshman at Lee county High school, where I am a cheerleader, a member of the Beta Club, and attend school. Today is the first "home" <br/>
     game for our boys' bsketball team. I have to stay after school and practice untill the game starts,(which is 6:00.) I was supposed to practice with the band after school <br/>
     (p.s. I play the flute for the LCHS marching band) but cheer trumps band in my scheduele. What I'm going to end up having to do is, praactice band for an hour or so, change to practice for cheer,<br/>
     run laps for being late, and then after practice change and get ready for the game, (and somehow find the time to eat) Sometimes being involved in so much is VERY hectic. I may edit in how the practices and game <br/>
     go, later tonight if I have time. xo Anna

  <h3> December 7, 2018.</h3>
  <p>
    Yesterday was a mess. I didn't get to practice for band, and cheer was TERRIBLE. Then at the game I saw the guy I really like, with another girl. After the game I litterally went home and cried myself to sleep. When I woke up (expecting snow) <br/>
    I looked out the window and was sincerly dissapointed that it didn't even flurry. I then started crying (again) and my mom was going to let me stay home and have a "me day." However my cheer coach thought something else. Today we are leaving to state competetion <br/>
    We are leaving right after school, getting a hotel and waking up early in the morning to get to the actual arena where the cometition is held. I broke my leg a couple of months ago and can't compete so I texted my coach and told her I was sick and wasn't able to go to the </br>
    competition. She then explained to me that if I didn't go, it was unexcuseable. So I had to fix my tear-stained face, pack a bag, and go to school. That's not even the thing that made me mad, 3 other "alternates" aren't going...why, you might ask? Because they are going to a PARADE. </br>
    Apperantely a parade is excuseable, but not being sick and a mini pre-midlife crisis. lol

    I apologize for being so inactive lately. I have been SUPER busy with cheer, band and school. This past weekend my family visited the Great Wolf Lodge in Mason, Ohio. Today is my first day back to school and I had two finals. I got a 82% on my chemistry final and don't have my </br>
results from math yet. However I recently started talking to the new boy, who is super sweet. He is on the basketball team and I hope to see him at practice tonight. This morning was rough because it was my first day back from a long weekend. The past few classes have been SLOWW and boring, </br>
and the class i'm in right now STINKS...bad, like B.O. and i'm starving because school lunch was sphagetti and I wouldn't eat it because it was school food which is nastyyy. Other than the fact that I can physically hear my stomach asking for food right now, today has been alright.

   Today has been a pretty good day. EXCEPT me and the new guy...aren't working out. He moved and didn't tell me, like excuse me did he not think that kinda information was important enough for me to know?!?! I guess not. My luck with guys, is CRAP! Other than that we've watched movies all day </br>
at school cause all of out finals are done. In band we're having a christmas party and I brought cupcakes. We have an away game to Estill co. today and I have to stay after and get ready, when all I wanna do is go home and sleep lol. I can't wait for christmas, I can't believe it's in a WEEK!!

     Today has been AWFUL. The last day of school is supposed to be easy, like what the heck?!? First of in 1st period we had our final and I got a 100% but I didn't get the extra bonus points because I misspelled the word by ONE LETTER. Then, all my friends are being brats and annoying. And yesterday I had to sit out the third quarter of the basketball game because my coach thought I was "mouthing" the cheers and not really saying the words, when I litterally lost my voice I was yelling so much. </br>
  And today at school I started my "girl days", just out of the blue...and my aunt had to bring me "supplies" and I had to carry them to the bathroom. YAY ME!
  at least it is the last day of school...until after the break!

        I have missed you guys so much and I am sorry I was gone so long! Yesterday was my first day back to school and it was alright. I got ivited to attend St. Johns University this summer for a medical program. The only thing is my family can't affored to send me so I didn't even apply. It was really sad... On the other hand, I have a Double Header game tonight in Owsley county. I have to go home and get something to eat, get ready and then catch the bus at 5:00. I had a good holiday break but its hard getting back into the routine of ballgames and practices everyday!
        Thank You all for the Love!

         Sorry I have not updated in almost a month lol. In the class where I usually update the blog, we started using a different program, and I have been super busy out of school and haven't had the time. Not much has happened since the last time I blogged. However...last Friday, my best friend got mad at me because I started hanging out with some new friends. She has cried all morning making everyone feel sorry for her, and mad at me...even though I didn't do anyting wrong. In my 4th period class, there are two cheerleaders whom I considered my friends, that wrote on the teacher's board and said,"Happy belated birthday (her name), don't let hoes hurt your feelings." that made me super upset because the only reason I didn't wish her Happy Birthday is a) she ignored me all day Friday and then all weekend, therefore I didn't think she would want me to. b) She blocked me from seeing her story (via:Snapchat) so I didn't know she was that upset. Long story short, I lost a bestfriend over something dumb and now half of the school hates me OVER THE SAME DUMB REASON. xo Anna
