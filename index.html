  <h2> December 6, 2018.</h2>
  <p>
     Today is my first day writing a blog, and I am excited to get this journey started. Before we get started about my day, I'll talk a little about myself.<br/>
     I am 14 years old. I am a Freshman at Lee county High school, where I am a cheerleader, a member of the Beta Club, and attend school. Today is the first "home" <br/>
     game for our boys' bsketball team. I have to stay after school and practice untill the game starts,(which is 6:00.) I was supposed to practice with the band after school <br/>
     (p.s. I play the flute for the LCHS marching band) but cheer trumps band in my scheduele. What I'm going to end up having to do is, praactice band for an hour or so, change to practice for cheer,<br/>
     run laps for being late, and then after practice change and get ready for the game, (and somehow find the time to eat) Sometimes being involved in so much is VERY hectic. I may edit in how the practices and game <br/>
     go, later tonight if I have time. xo Anna
